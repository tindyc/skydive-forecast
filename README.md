# 🪂 Skydive Forecast  
[🌐 Live Demo](https://tindyc.github.io/skydive-forecast/)  

Planning a jump in the UK? This app helps skydivers check the latest weather at selected dropzones and see if conditions are safe for beginners or experienced jumpers.  

Because sometimes the biggest leap isn’t out of the plane—it’s trusting the weather. 🌤️

## 📊 New: Jump Stats & Visual Forecasts  

I’ve added an **analytics layer** to help skydivers understand conditions at a glance — not just raw numbers.  

### 🔹 Smarter Insights  
The **backend now summarizes the raw forecast into meaningful insights**, including:
 
- 🌡 **Average temperature** over the forecast period.  
- 💨 **Average wind speed**.  
- ✅ **Number of safe jump days** for Beginners vs Experienced skydivers.  
- 🎯 **Best Jump Day** – automatically highlighted in a banner at the very top. Click it to instantly view full forecast details in the main card.


#### Example Output  

When you request the forecast for a dropzone, the app also returns an **analytics summary** like this for each selected dropzone:  

```json
"analytics": {
  "avg_temp": 18.6,
  "avg_wind": 12.2,
  "jumpable_days_beginner": 3,
  "jumpable_days_experienced": 6,
  "total_days": 10
}

```
---
**Explained:**  
- 🌡 **avg_temp** → average daily max temperature (**18.6°C**).  
- 💨 **avg_wind** → average wind speed (**12.2 mph**).  
- ✅ **jumpable_days_beginner** → safe days for beginners (**3 days**).  
- ✅ **jumpable_days_experienced** → safe days for experienced skydivers (**6 days**).  
- 📅 **total_days** → number of forecast days (**10**).  

So in this example:  
- Beginners can expect **3 safe days** in the next 10.  
- Experienced skydivers have more flexibility with **6 safe days**.  
- Average conditions are **18.6°C** with winds around **12 mph**.  

---

### 🔹 Easy-to-Read Visuals  

The frontend uses **Recharts** to display:  
- **Bar Chart** → safe days for Beginners vs Experienced.  
- **Heatmap Calendar** → daily jumpability (🟢 good, 🟡 marginal, 🔴 unsafe).  
- **Key Stats Cards** → quick view of average temp 🌡 and wind speed💨.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**  
  - React + TypeScript  
  - React Router – slug-based navigation (`/dropzone/skydive-langar`)  
  - Recharts – interactive bar charts & heatmaps  
  - Responsive CSS + tooltips  

- **Backend**  
  - AWS Lambda + API Gateway – serverless forecast API  
  - Python + Pandas – data analytics & safety rules  
  - Open-Meteo API – free forecast provider  

- **Automation**  
  - Python Scraper (Playwright + Google Geocoding API) – updates `dropzones.json` automatically  
  - GitHub Actions – automates: scraper → commit → Lambda deploy → frontend build & deploy  

---

## 🚀 Phase 2 — Upgrades & Optimizations  

### 🔹 Automated Dropzones  
- Python scraper (`tools/scraper.py`) fetches dropzone names from British Skydiving.  
- Uses Google Geocoding API for lat/lon.  
- Updates `public/dropzones.json` automatically.  

### 🔹 CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Workflow (`.github/workflows/update-dropzones.yml`) automates:  
  - Running the scraper  
  - Committing `dropzones.json`  
  - Deploying Lambda  
  - Building & publishing frontend to GitHub Pages  

### 🔹 Optimized Lambda  
- **Before:** fetched forecasts for *all dropzones* → very slow.  
- **Now:** fetches only the **requested dropzone** via `?dz=DropzoneName`.  
- Applies beginner/experienced rules server-side.  
- ✅ Faster, smaller payloads  
- ✅ Always in sync with scraper updates

## 🏗️ Architecture  

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/assets/img/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="900"/>
</p>

### Flow  
1. **Scraper (Python + Playwright + Google API)**  
   - Scrapes dropzones → geocodes → saves to `dropzones.json`.  
   - GitHub Actions commits updates.  

2. **Frontend (React, GitHub Pages)**  
   - Loads dropzones from JSON.  
   - Renders forecasts + analytics visually.  

3. **API Gateway + Lambda (Python + Pandas)**  
   - Handles requests (`?dz=DropzoneName`).  
   - Fetches forecast from Open-Meteo.  
   - Applies safety rules.  
   - Returns forecast + analytics + heatmap.  

4. **Frontend UI**  
   - Displays daily forecasts, analytics cards, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/skydive-forecast.git
   cd skydive-forecast
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
````
npm install
````

3. ***Start the app locally***
```
npm run dev
```

4. ***Deploy ( GitHub Pages)***
In App.tsx, make sure the router is wrapped with:
```
<Router basename="/skydive-forecast">
````
Then build and publish with:
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Future Ideas
1. Add more dropzones (UK & worldwide 🌍). 

 Added ✅

2. Notifications/alerts when a “GOOD ✅” day is coming up.

 Added ✅

3. Altitude-adjusted forecasts – calculate conditions at jump altitude (not just ground).

4. Data analytics & graphs:

* Use Pandas to process the fetched weather data.

* Show averages, min, max of wind speed, temperature, and cloud cover.

Added ✅

* Highlight how many “GOOD ✅” days are expected in the next 10 days.

* Add trend charts (line graphs of wind speeds, temperatures, rain probability).

5. Visual dashboards:

* Bar charts for “jumpable vs no-jump days” per dropzone.

* Pie charts comparing beginner vs experienced safe days.

Added ✅

* Rolling averages to show seasonal patterns (e.g., best months to jump).

6. User experience features:

* Allow users to favourite dropzones and view combined stats.

* Compare two dropzones side by side (e.g., Hibaldstow vs Langar).

* Export reports (PDF or CSV) with conditions summary.

7. Machine learning ideas:

* Predict the best jump days using past data + forecast trends.

* Show “confidence scores” for forecasts.
